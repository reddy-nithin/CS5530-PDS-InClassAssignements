This type of dataset is often referred to as a high dimensional dataset. Now, with this high dimensionality, comes a lot of problems such as - this high dimensionality will significantly increase the training time of your machine learning model, it can make your model very complicated which in turn may lead to Overfitting.\n",
        "Often in a high dimensional feature set, there remain several features which are redundant meaning these features are nothing but extensions of the other essential features. These redundant features do not effectively contribute to the model training as well. So, clearly, there is a need to extract the most important and the most relevant features for a dataset in order to get the most effective predictive modeling performance."

Also, let's segregate the data into separate variables so that the features and the labels are separated, this will help in feature selection.The scikit-learn library provides the SelectKBest class that can be used with a suite of different statistical tests to select a specific number of features, in this case, it is Chi-Squared.

        "Most of the times, your dataset will contain features highly varying in magnitudes, units and range. But since, most of the machine learning algorithms use Euclidean distance between two data points in their computations, this is a problem.If left alone, these algorithms only take in the magnitude of features neglecting the units. The results would vary greatly between different units, 5kg and 5000gms. The features with high magnitudes will weigh in a lot more in the distance calculations than features with low magnitudes. To suppress this effect, we need to bring all features to the same level of magnitudes. This can be achieved by scaling"
